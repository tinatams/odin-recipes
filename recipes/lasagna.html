        <h1>Lasagna</h1>

        <p>A simple lasagna recipe that takes about half the effort. I always cook extra to have leftovers, but the more I cook, the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Warm water</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Dried oregano</li>
            <li>Black ground pepper</li>
            <li>Minced garlic</li>
            <li>Marinara or any tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Mozzeralla cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sauce.Cook ground beef, until browned. Drain excess grease and add spices and minced garlic. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190C</li>
            <li>Prepare the pan for baking Spoon a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, then sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce and repeat layering, ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese for later.</li>
            <li>Bake n the preheated oven for 45 minutes, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle reserved cheese over the top and return to the oven until melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
