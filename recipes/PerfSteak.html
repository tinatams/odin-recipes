    <p>This is how I cook the ABSOLUTE PERFECT!! steak!! Amazing yummy juice nom nom</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Steak Seasoning, salt and peper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Roughly chopped garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the steaks by massaging steak seasoning, salt, and pepper into the steaks making sure they are fully covered. Optionally you can also add oil to help the seasoning stick</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan with no oil. When the pan is hot, put the steak into the pan (it should sizzle a little).</li>
        <li>When one side of the steak is crispy (after about 2 minutes or less depending on how you like your steaks) flip your steak over</li>
        <li>When the other side of the steak is turning crispy add buter and garlic cloves into the pan. Baste your steak by spooning butter over your steaks. Flip your steak again and baste the other side</li>
    </ol>
