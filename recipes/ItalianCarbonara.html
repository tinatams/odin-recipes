    <p>Amazing italian carbonara, made with yummy yummy bacon and real eggs. The creaminess of this pasta comes with how the eggs are cooked to make the sauce! When you try this recipe you will <strong>NEVER</strong> go back!!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Pasta and Pasta Water</li>
        <li>Parmasean Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning (thyme, oregano, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook your pasta noodles, according to the instructions on the packaging until al dente. Strain your noodles, while keeping your pasta sauce for later</li>
        <li>Make the carbonara sauce by mixing egg yolks with parmasean cheese, salt, pepper, and other spices you want in a bowl. Mix until it forms a paste.</li>
        <li>Cook your bacon in a deep pan, until the bacon is crispy. Do not use excess oil, the bacon fat will render releasing its own oil</li>
        <li>Once your bacon is rendered, lower the heat. Pour a bit of pasta water in the pan with the bacon to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add butter and stir</li>
        <li>Once the butter is hot enough, add in roughly minced garlic, keep stirring until butter is browned or garlic is thoroughly cooked</li>
        <li>Add your pasta to the pot and stir until the noodles are coated with the butter. Once the noodels are thoroughly coated, turn off the heat</li>
        <li>Pour the paste onto the noodles <em>slowly</em> and stir vigarously until mixed properly. Alternate this with pouring pasta water until texture is to liking.</li>
    </ol>
